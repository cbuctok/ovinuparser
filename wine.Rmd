This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook I use for studing R.

There's no reason for this language to exist but man how good is everything about it (except some horrible limitations).

After some time I understood that it was made to keep one category of people away from the world and be comfortable in their dreamland. Let's have a peek what's going on there. Be prepared - it is beautiful and makes no sense!

# Dataset

I collected it via scraping wich was fun.

Also I wrote some scripts, boring ones are not going to be explained nor shown.

```{r}
source('main.R')
```

# Simple tables

## Wine colour popularity in Slovenia

```{r}
barve()
```


## Temperature vs Colour

```{r}

```

## Winery

```{r}

```
